        - src : where we put our code

    > making component in separate file (SoC)
        - make regular JS file
        - make the function
        - export function : export default FunctionName
        - import to designated file : import FunctionName from 'file location'
        - use . to indicate its from the same folder
        - we can also use export in front of function
        - use {} to import that isnt default function
        - we can use props.children to change the contents

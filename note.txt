    > Create React App (CRA)
        - usually when people want to make react app they're using CRA for initialization
        - theres a feature called react refresh that allow change in  DOM without refreshing in browser
    
    > init CRA
        - to initialize CRA we can visit this link https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app
    
    > understanding contents inside project react using CRA
        - node modules : manage dependencies
        - public : folder to put static files
        - src : where we put our code

    > making component in separate file (SoC)
        - make regular JS file
        - make the function
        - export function : export default FunctionName
        - import to designated file : import FunctionName from 'file location'
        - use . to indicate its from the same folder
        - we can also use export in front of function
        - use {} to import that isnt default function
        - we can use props.children to change the contents
